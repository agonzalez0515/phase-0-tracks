Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.


1. look up definition
2. look up cheat sheets
3. look up examples on w3schools to play around with

use Pomodoro method, 25 mins to learn, 5 min break, 25 min to try it, 5 min break

Sometimes I like to look at youtube but not too often, it's last resort type of thing.

Best thing for me is to find the cheat sheets and examples and try to figure out what's going on.
