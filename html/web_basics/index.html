<p><em><big> The big surprise of the night was when Triple H, who has not been seen since April at Wrestlemania, showed up unannounced and pedigreed both Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins.  The match was a <strong>NO DQ</strong> so there was nothing anyone could do about it! He handed Kevin Owens the championship!!!</big></em></p>
