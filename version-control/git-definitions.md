**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the management of information (such as files), allowing multiple versions of said information to exist, by recording changes and allowing access to previous versions. This is valuable since it allows an organized, robust system to make changes to the information. It also allows easier collaboration among people, as each person can have their own version to work on.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a repository that is saved separately, allowing diverging changes to then be made. A branch could be merged back into the original repository, if desired. You would use a branch when you may want to take the project into a different direction. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you update your local repository with any alterations, and it also acts as a backup point if you want to rollback to it. A good commit message indicates what exactly was altered, in order to help keep track of, and pinpoint, any potential problems.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two different branches attempt to merge with each other, but they have different changes to a same area of a file. Git will not know which change should be accepted, since they both change the same area. Git will throw up a "merge conflict," allowing the user to choose what edit to use.
